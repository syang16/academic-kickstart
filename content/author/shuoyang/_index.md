I obtained my PhD degree from Indiana University-Bloomington in 2017, with thesis titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00749.pdf"> <u>"Effective Learning of Probabilistic Models for Clinical Predictions from Longitudinal Data".</u></a>. My PhD research was conducted under the guidance of <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~sriraam.natarajan/">Prof. Sriraam Natarajan</a> and mainly focuses on machine learning and its application to medical domains, including statistical relational learning, knowledge-based learning, cost-sensitive learning, SRL for sequential events prediction and SRL in hybrid domains.
